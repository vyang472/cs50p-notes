The step to Begin 
Log into cs50.dev, click on your terminal window, and execute cd by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

$
Next execute

mkdir deep
to make a folder called deep in your codespace.

Then execute

cd deep
to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as deep/ $. You can now execute

code deep.py
to make a file called deep.py where you’ll write your program.

You can execute the below to check your code using check50, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that check50 outputs to see the input check50 handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

How to Submit

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.
